Where are we today?
Building a tabs components
Loads of JS
Markup is atrocious

<select>
  - default UI
  - configurable attributes
  - changing appearance/behavior with attributes
  - changing appearance with composition
  - ignoring bogus markup
  - changing behavior with different context
  - spec'd(?) -- slide is too small
